# Career Connection

![career services logo](assets/logo.png)

Welcome back to another Career Connection! This week you spent more time developing your skills in interactive data visualization using D3.js, Leaflet.js, and more JavaScript to engage with the GeoJSON file type. We’re excited to spend a little time with you again to show you how this material is applicable to your future career in data.

It’s time for you to boost your profile and make yourself more marketable by employing some Employer Competitive strategies—consider how you can use the material you’ve learned this week to become more employer competitive. 

- Write an article on [Medium.com](https://medium.com/):
  - This doesn’t need to be a comprehensive tutorial. It could be a walkthrough of an activity you did this week, or it could be an overview of your journey in learning data visualization and analysis so far. Most important, though, is that you keep it clean and well-written, short, and a tool to market your own portfolio—so don’t forget to add links to your portfolio, your GitHub, and maybe even your email address at the end of the article.

  - Doing this will help you build your visibility as well as help you reflect on what you have learned so far.

- Update your resume with your new skillset:
  - If you haven’t already done so, add Leaflet.js and GeoJSON to your resume in the “Technical Skills” section. Display it loud and proud!

## Technical Interview

Remember how we at Career Services keep saying that technical interviewing is a skill that requires constant practice and development? Now you get to practice this a little more… again! Remember, remember, remember: Employers are looking not only for the right answer, but they’re looking to see your process and how you approach a topic—so even if you don’t know the right answer, it’s not the end of the world! Use the opportunity to demonstrate how you tackle questions that you don’t readily know the answer to.

Jot down the things you might say in response to one of these questions before viewing the answer.

**1. What is Leaflet?**

Leaflet is an extremely popular, open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. It helps us display and visualize data in ways that are user-friendly and meaningful for data analysts and nonexperts alike.

**2. Tell me about your experience using Leaflet?**

There is no concrete answer here, but the “tell me about” format is extremely popular in interviews. It is an open-ended question that invites you to sell your skills! Write down your experiences using Leaflet this week. What were the challenges? How did you overcome them? What did you learn that is applicable to the job you’re applying for?

**3. What is the GeoJSON data format?**

GeoJSON is an open standard format, which is essentially a type of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) for representing geographical features along with their nonspatial attributes. It is commonly used with libraries like Leaflet.js.

### Case Study

> If you’ve ever travelled to London, England, you likely stepped foot onto the London Underground and heard the iconic “Mind the Gap” announcement over the loudspeaker system. You’d also know that the London Underground is a complex web of train lines that have grown over the last century with no great planning or grid system—it is, quite simply, a masterful maze of tunnels.
>
> Locals are usually very good at knowing where to go, which train lines start and stop, and where and when they’re going to arrive. But for literally millions of tourists visiting London each year, it can be a mind-boggling adventure. So the Mayor of London has posted a job searching for a data analytics professional who can create a mobile-friendly interactive map.
>
> The specs state that a user must be able to:
>
> - Use a mobile device to access the map on-the-go.
> - View each of the London Underground lines with a different color.
> - Click on a line and get more information about a particular train, its stops, and arrival intervals.
> - View each Underground station as a point on the map.
> - Click each Underground station point and get more information about the trains that pass through it.
>
> You applied and successfully convinced the astute HR Recruiter that you know what you’re talking about. Now you’re meeting with the development team for your technical interview.

For each of the following questions that you might field during your interview, write down your answers before viewing our suggestions!

- **In thinking about this map, what data format and libraries might you use to create an interactive mobile-friendly application?**
  - If you didn’t guess it, Leaflet.js and GeoJSON are the go-to technologies here. Consider these technologies for each of the following questions.

- **What would you use to map each of the train lines?**
  - A GeoJSON LineString might be mapped as a Leaflet vector to represent the train lines. 

- **What would you use to map each of the station points of interest?**
  - A GeoJSON point might be mapped as a Leaflet vector to represent each of the stations.

- **If you wanted to highlight a whole neighborhood on the map, how would you do it?**
  - A GeoJSON MultiPolygon might be mapped as a Leaflet vector to represent the different neighborhoods.
