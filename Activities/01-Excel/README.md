### Career Services

Each week students will review a Career Connection document in the [04-Career-Modules folder](../../04-Career-Modules/). This Career Connection relates this week's material to a professional setting, encourages students to complete certain Career Services tasks, and provides technical interviewing questions, where applicable, that the student can work through.

This week, **please push the entire folder to the student repository** so that these can be accessed and let students know that related Career Services material can be found in this supplemental folder.

If you'd like more information on Career Services, visit the [Career Services resources page](https://mycareerspot.org/).
